[Sqale](https://sqale.jp/) is a cloud application platform for Ruby from [paperboy&co., Inc](http://www.paperboy.co.jp), Japan.

Sqale uses some Ruby technologies and others like these in its backend.

 * Ruby/Ruby On Rails
 * Puppet/Chef
 * Resque
 * Unicorn
 * AWS(EC2, ELB, RDS, Route53)
 * Patched version of OpenSSH
 * Patched version of Linux kernel
 * Nginx + lua-nginx-module
 * Redis
 * Git
 * LXC
 * etc.

I will talk about the backend architecture of Sqale through explaining how we use these technologies in it.

If you are interested in the inside architecture of a cloud application platform, this session will be very helpful.
