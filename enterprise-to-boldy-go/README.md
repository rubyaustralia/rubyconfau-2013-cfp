# Enterprise: To boldy go.

A talk on why Ruby is a compelling choice for "enterprise" applications, and the introduction of Ruby apps to organisations where Java- and .NET-based solutions are prevalent.

I would like to explore topics that include:

- Ruby culture, community, enthusiasm and philosophy
- Being "enterprise-grade"
- Time-to-market and ROI considerations
- Integration with legacy and other platforms, databases and services
- Working with operations and support teams
- Scalability
- Myths
- Essential tools
- Reskilling and new hires.
- "The First Project"
- Ruby in a Windows-centric world
- Case studies: Fairfax Media and Cochlear

## Steven Ringo

I am a Sydney-based independent consultant focused on the development of web and mobile applications using Ruby and Rails. I am currently working with Fairfax to develop Ruby-based projects for their metropolitan masthead publications.

Coming from the world of Delphi and Java, I fell in love with Ruby in 2007. I am an organiser of the Ruby Rails Oceania user group in Sydney.

I have also worked with companies including Cochlear, Ernst & Young and CommInsure. Prior to migrating to Australia, I was the founder and CTO of the largest private stored-value card company in Africa.
