# Your first year in Legacy Code

Working in heavy Legacy Code with no structure is challenging. If you really want to improve yourself in such an "hostile" environment,
you need the right tools and strategies.

In this talk I will cover:

- what I learned during my first year working in the IT business.
- big victories against simple
- sometimes you just have to give up
- methods to save your mind from getting insane
- we are all sitting in the same boat, let's do the best to stay above the water

Learn better ways to do this. This talk is about my own experience in working such a project that will help you to become a better
programmer (or at least save your mind from freaking out).

Length of the talk: ~25 minutes
