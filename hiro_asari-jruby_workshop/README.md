# JRuby workshop

JRuby is a Ruby language implementation on the JVM. The JRuby core team
members Charles Oliver Nutter and Hiro Asari lead the first JRuby
workshop in the Southern Hemisphere.

Topics we will cover

1. JRuby overview: installation, getting started
1. Java and Ruby integration: loading and calling libraries
1. JRuby on Rails: building and deploying
1. JRuby for fun and more fun: Minecraft plugin with [Purugin](https://github.com/enebo/Purugin)(or something similar)
1. JRuby debugging and performance tuning: finding problems

Attendees should have a Java VM installed (Java 6 or higher) and have
familiarity with the basics of Ruby. RVM will make installation easier,
but it is not required.
