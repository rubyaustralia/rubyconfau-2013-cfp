# The Setup: Managing an Army of Laptops with Puppet

As a rapidly growing company, GitHub's faced some challenges in how
to make sure that everyone can get up and running on projects or continue to
work on one of the dozens of existing projects if they've never set it up before.
What a nightmare!
That's what prompted @jbarnette and @wfarr to develop The Setup.
The Setup aims to solve all the problems that used to plague on-boarding
GitHubbers onto projects with a lot of automation and a case of the
"It Just Works".
This presentation talks about the history of The Setup, how it works,
and some of the lessons learned along the way.
