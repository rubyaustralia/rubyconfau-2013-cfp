# Harnessing the power of Ruby and ZooKeeper to handle Redis failover

Ruby developers typically use Ruby for web development with Rails. Most conference 
talks cover popular topics such as web development and testing.
I want to invite the audience to engage in a journey that involves thinking about
problems that most web developers don't face every day. In this talk, I'll explain
how you can yield the power of Ruby and ZooKeeper to solve tough problems 
(specifically, using Redis failover as an example): 

* How do you handle distributed monitoring among a set of Ruby processes?
* How can you employ Ruby's flexibility to dynamically inject different failover
strategies at runtime?
* How can you use Ruby's concurrency utilities (i.e., Threads) to solve tough problems?
* How do you test a distributed system in Ruby?

I think this will be an interesting talk for this conference. Developers are 
beginning to rely on Redis more and more as a way to massively scale. I also 
think that Ruby developers are becoming more and more interested in topics 
beyond generic web development. This talk will marry the "familiar" (using Redis) 
with the "unfamiliar" (how to use Ruby and other tools to solve tough, 
non-web-related problems).

Here is a link to a lightning talk that I gave about redis_failover 
at a recent Ruby conference in Barcelona:

This is just a lightning talk. If given the opportunity to speak at your conference,
I will go into much more detail with a more Ruby-focused view. I want to get the 
Ruby community excited about doing cool things with Ruby outside of web development!

Currently a Rubyist at [Spreecast](http://www.spreecast.com). I am the author of 
[redis_failover](http://github.com/ryanlecompte/redis_failover). I'm interested 
in teaching others how to do cool things with Ruby outside of your 
normal Rails web development.
