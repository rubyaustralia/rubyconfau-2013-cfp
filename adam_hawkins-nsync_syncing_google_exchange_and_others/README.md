# N'Sync: Connecting Google, Exchange, and Others

This talk covers the basics in creating a reusable sync service that connects an 
application to various external systems (Google, MS Exchange, others) 
over a standard interface. It describes the processing for making the 
service accessible over HTTP The talk covers the architecture using OOP 
design patterns, requirements, implementations, and use cases. Best
part, it's all Ruby with a dash of meta programming.

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as

work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
