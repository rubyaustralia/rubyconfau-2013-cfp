# Hacker's Quest: An introduction to web application security

Information is one of the most valuable assets of the modern day organisation. As Ruby developers we build web applications to store, process, present and distribute our organisation's information. At the same time we need to protect this information; we need to manage it's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This makes web application security a very relevant topic in the work we do.

Hacker's Quest is a presentation that demonstrates the process of hacking into a fictional Ruby on Rails web application. The presentation highlights common web application security vulnerabilities, shows how these vulnerabilities can be exploited and how we can protect against these in our Ruby code. We'll hack deeper into the application in several stages, pausing after every stage to summarise the learnings.

Hacker's Quest will introduce the audience to web application security principles, a few "hacker" tools and how to think like a "hacker". The demonstration will illustrate how to bypass authentication, steal user credentials, read confidential data from the database, upload malicious code and execute commands on the server - and also how to prevent all this from happening in our Ruby code.
