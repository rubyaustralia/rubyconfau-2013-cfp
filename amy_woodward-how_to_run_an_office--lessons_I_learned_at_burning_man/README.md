# How to Run an Office - Lessons I Learned at Burning Man

"In the fall of 2011, I left the city I'd lived in most of my adult life - San Francisco - to move to a city hundreds of kilometers north, where I knew no one, and where it rains all the time.

"The city was Portland, Oregon, and I moved to open and run a new engineering office.

"Fortunately, ironically, my years working and playing at the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com/) Festival - creating a city for just one week, in a salt flat, in the desert - prepared me well for this new challenge."

Sadly, I don't have video of past talks. The largest one was my "Humpty Dumpty" talk at Conferencia Rails (July 2011) in Madrid. It was a 40 minute talk at a 100+ person conference. It was well-received (based on tweets and conversations!) Recorded, too, but I can't locate the video.

I also present at local Ruby and AWS user groups, and have taught several times at Railsbridge in San Francisco, Portland, and Bend, OR.
