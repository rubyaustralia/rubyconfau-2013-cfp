# Homebrew: History and HOWTO

A brief overview of what Homebrew is, why it was created, how to use it and how to create packages for it.  

I'll discuss technology choices, how to get help and some insights from helping run a open-source project with thousands of contributors that builds thousands of other projects.  

## Mike McQuaid

I'm one of the Homebrew core contributors and work for AllTrails as a software engineer from my home in Broughty Ferry, Scotland.  

You can read more in my [curriculum vitæ/resumé](http://mikemcquaid.com/cv/) or [my Ohloh page](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/mikemcquaid) which tracks some of my open-source contributions.
