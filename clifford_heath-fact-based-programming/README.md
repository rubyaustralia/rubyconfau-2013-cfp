# Fact-based programming using the ActiveFacts API

Natural descriptions of real situations are expressed using facts about things.
By dividing things into objects and attributes, programmers create unnatural
abstractions. It's not enough that Ruby uses objects for attribute values.
Relevant behaviours of these values usually get forced into their owner object.
Meaningless object identifiers (isolated from attribute values) also create problems.

This talk shows how a fact-based approach to programming can avoid these problems.
The constellation data structure implemented by the activefacts-api (gem) provides
a radical new approach to thinking about data semantics and program function.

Clifford has been a software designer and toolmaker for three decades, having
been inventor and architect of multiple major software products that have won
over a hundred million export dollars for Australia.  He was also one of the
first Australians to make the switch to Ruby, and his gem downloads outnumber
any other Australian author. His work in semantic (fact-based) modelling holds
enormous promise for a renewal of trust in the IT industry by its clients.
