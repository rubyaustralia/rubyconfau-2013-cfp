# Fact-based programming using the ActiveFacts API

We describe real situations using facts about things. So why do we allow
object-orientation to force us to divide things into objects and attributes?
The same happens when we design relational databases, except worse.

It's not enough compensation that Ruby uses objects for attribute values.  Many
values have their own behaviours, which should not get forced into owner objects.
Meaningless object identifiers (isolated from attribute values) also create problems.

This talk shows how a fact-based approach to programming can avoid these problems.
The constellation data structure implemented by the activefacts-api (gem) provides
a radical new approach to data semantics and program function, and is the core of a
new database definition and query language (CQL) and a new O/RM (under development).

been inventor and architect of multiple major software products that have won
over a hundred million export dollars for Australia.  He was also one of the
first Australians to make the switch to Ruby, and his gem downloads outnumber
any other Australian author. His work in semantic (fact-based) modelling holds
enormous promise for a renewal of trust in the IT industry by its clients.
