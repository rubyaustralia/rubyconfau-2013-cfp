# Fact-based programming using the ActiveFacts API

We talk about real situations using facts about things. So why do we allow
object-orientation to force us to divide things into objects and attributes?
The same happens when we design relational databases, except worse, especially
if we're using Active Record.

Although Ruby uses objects for attribute values, many values have their own
behaviours, which should not get forced into owner objects.  Meaningless object
identifiers and surrogate DB keys (isolated from attribute values) also create
data quality problems like data duplication and contradiction.

This talk shows how a fact-based approach to programming can avoid these
problems.  Unlike an object, a fact cannot be duplicated, just re-asserted -
it's still the same fact.  The constellation data structure implemented by
the activefacts-api (gem) provides a radical new approach to data semantics
and program function, and is the core of a new database definition and query
language (CQL) and a new O/RM (under development).

been inventor and architect of multiple major software products that have won
over a hundred million export dollars for Australia.  He was also one of the
first Australians to make the switch to Ruby, and his gem downloads outnumber
any other Australian author. His work in semantic (fact-based) modelling holds
enormous promise for a renewal of trust in the IT industry by its clients.
