# Behind the Curtain

It may seem unusual, but my greatest understanding of software development comes not from computer courses or books but from my background in Theatre. In a performance many separate parts (acting, lighting, sound, costumes) must be developed independently, but still form a cohesive whole to express a director’s vision. The same is true of software development. Design, code, databases, testing, etc. must all connect seamlessly to form an illusion for your audience. This talk will show you how to coordinate these disparate elements and create an extraordinary experience.

This talk will include information on assembling your cast and crew, dealing with divas, knowing how to say no to impossible requests, rehearsals, maintaining your sanity when receiving reviews, and much more.

NOTE:  I previously gave this talk at Madison Ruby 2012.  I have included links to both the slides and the video of the talk.  I will be adding new content should it be selected for RubyConf Australia.
