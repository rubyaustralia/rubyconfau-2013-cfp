# Ruby and Riak in the Cloud

Riak’s highly available nature makes it ideal for cloud environments where any of your resources may disappear without notice but your database must still be up. Unfortunately databases need IO and the cloud, where everything is virtualized, is not the most performant place to run one. Getting started with Riak in the cloud brings a different set of assumptions than hardware based installations and we’ll go through them together. 

Come hear the tale of 2 engineers who have no hardware but decided to try Riak for a production-critical Ruby application. We’ll tell you how we ported our application from MySQL, rolled it to production, and the lessons we learned while running Riak in the Cloud.

## Speaker info

Michael Brodhead, mkb to his pals, is a programmer at Engine Yard in San Francisco.  After a journey through more programming languages than he can count, Mike settled on Ruby to fill the hours between breakfast and queuing up an early Black Sabbath album.

Ines Sombra is the Lead Data Engineer at Engine Yard, where she spends her time thinking about how to improve the provisioning, configuration, and backups of data stores.  Her current mission is to incorporate exciting NoSQL databases into the stack. Being a true Argentinean, Ines subsists almost entirely on Steak and Fernet.
