# Beer Driven Development

Grab several bottle of beers and start programming - that's what I did. This talk will explain how beer can boost your
productivity when solving hard problems. It is no joke, if drink a certain amount of beer, something will change in your mind.
After the talk wen can test put the facts of this talk into practice.
