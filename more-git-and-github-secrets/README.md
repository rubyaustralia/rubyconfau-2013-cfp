# More Git and GitHub Secrets

Git and GitHub are both tools that can be used to help you build things. If
you get better with those tools, you'll build things quicker. If you're really
good, your products will just start materializing out of thin air like some
sort of freaky efficient ghost situation thing.

So learn better ways to do just that. This talk is about loading you up with
zillions of Git and GitHub tips that'll make you a way better developer (or at
least someone who knows arcane knowledge about Git and GitHub).

### Secret Information Aside

So I gave a ["Git and GitHub Secrets" talk](http://zachholman.com/talk/git-github-secrets)
a couple times this year, so this isn't a newish idea from me, but by the time
RubyConf comes around next year I'm sure half the talk will be outdated or boring
or I'll otherwise dislike it. I've already been keeping tabs on new things I want
to include in a future talk, so you can safely consider the *content* of this talk
to be new.
