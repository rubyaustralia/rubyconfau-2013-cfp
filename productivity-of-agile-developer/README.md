# Productivity of an Agile Developer

In my talk, I will deliberate about my journey where I change myself from messy to happy developer. I will share my experience how I got productive, organised and focused while developing.
To be more specific, the talk will have three parts: 
-	Productive while coding
-	Productivity while doing pair programming
-	Productivity during meetings 

In these three parts I will talk and show few demo about: 
-	Get use to tools like tmux, divvy, vim etc 
-	Your mouse kills 
-   Spend time on dot files
-	Arrange meetings 
-	Work desk setup
-	Good way to run Unit Test case and see logs
-	Organize your information
-	Stop Multitasking
-	Go home at same time everyday.
-	And many more

##Outcome 
You become more productive, organized and focused developer.
