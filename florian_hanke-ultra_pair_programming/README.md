# Ultra Pair Programming

This talk will be held together with Andy Kitchen and it is a live crowsourcing experiment.

By now you all know pair programming and its advantages.
What if you add more people? What if you split up a bigger problem into many small ones and people compete or collaborate in real time to improve the code? What if you visualize progress on a big screen? Add in some social media features for motivation and stir.

This talk is will either excite, be hilarious, or fail utterly. In any case it will be memorable.

Perhaps RubyConf Australia will see the mythical man-month itself turn into a myth?

The title of the talk is pronounced "ULTRA. PAIR. PROGRAMMING."
