# CSI:Ruby

The worst kind of legacy code is convoluted, labyrinthine, and devilishly difficult to change. It also tells a dramatic story that is packed with valuable lessons about simplicity and constraints.

In this episode of CSI:Ruby, we follow two investigations that lead us deep into the fascinating underworld of disorganized crime, where we expose illegitimate connections between objects and the ways in which they conspire.

Upon the conclusion of our investigation, you will be equipped to systematically uncover flaws in design of your own code, allowing you to prevent its untimely demise.

## Katrina Owen

Katrina ran away from the circus and found her true home in the land of computers and code. She enjoys optimizing and automating, taking busywork away from smart people and putting it into code where it belongs. She is the problem solver you want on your side. She is driven by an inexplicable urge to refactor, and has for the past 6 years volunteered as a nitpicker at the javaranch.com Cattle Drive, where she attempts to brainwash others to write clean code. She appreciates a good steak, and admits to enjoying a nice stick fight.
