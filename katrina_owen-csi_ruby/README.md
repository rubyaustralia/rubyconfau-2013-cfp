# CSI:Ruby

The worst kind of legacy code is convoluted, labyrinthine, and devilishly difficult to change. It also tells a dramatic story that is packed with valuable lessons about simplicity and constraints.

In this episode of CSI:Ruby, we follow an investigation that leads us deep into the fascinating underworld of disorganized crime, where we expose illegitimate connections between objects and the ways in which they conspire.

Upon the conclusion of our investigation, you will be equipped to systematically conduct investigations of your own, allowing you to objectively decide the fate of your code.

## Notes about the talk

This talk is about reading code, about the process of approaching an unfamiliar codebase, and reasoning about what's there. It's real code from a real production environment which has been anonymized to protect the innocent. Or guilty, as the case may be.

The code will not be transformed (i.e. it's not about refactoring), and the focus of the talk is on the story more than the code itself. The code is simply an excuse to talk about interesting lessons that lurk in the complexity of our legacy codebases, and is used to heighten the drama and underline important points and for the occasional comedic relief.

There are two levels of takeaways in the presentation:

First, the obvious takeaway is "investigation 101" or "how to read code".

Second, the underlying points and higher-level take-aways are about the value and lessons that hide in legacy code: about incidental vs inherent complexity, simplicity and the creative use of constraints, and the difficult choice of when to rewrite vs when to refactor.

> Brilliantly informative storytelling. @kytrinyx absolutely killed it in her refactoring talk at @nordicruby. My new idol. - [@copiousfreetime](https://twitter.com/copiousfreetime/status/213604216529362944)

## Katrina Owen

Katrina ran away from the circus and found her true home in the land of computers and code. She enjoys optimizing and automating, taking busywork away from smart people and putting it into code where it belongs. She is the problem solver you want on your side. She is driven by an inexplicable urge to refactor, and has for the past 6 years volunteered as a nitpicker at the javaranch.com Cattle Drive, where she attempts to brainwash others to write clean code. She appreciates a good steak, and admits to enjoying a nice stick fight.
