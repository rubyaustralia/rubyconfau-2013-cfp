# Using Ruby to Fix Javascript Development

Modern Javascript development is a landmine. You have to deal with code
organization, minification, compression, and automated testing.
Javascript's nature makes this even more difficult. Since it only exists
inside a browser, you cannot do things (easily) like you would in
another programming language. We need to use other tools to solve the
toolchain problem. We can cobble together a bunch of different tools and
wire them together to finally create an integrated Javascript
toolchain--all available from the CLI and ready for CI.

This talk goes indepth into the inner workings of Iridium and why we
needed Ruby to make our Javascript development work

## My Name

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
