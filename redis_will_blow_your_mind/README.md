# Redis: the little database that will BLOW YOUR MIND

[Redis](http://redis.io/) has been around for a while now. Many Rubyists have heard of it, but fewer will have started using it in their apps. In this talk, I'll get you across that line. Redis already sounds useful in theory, but it becomes _awesome_ in practice.

I'll cover:

* Redis fundamentals, and how it's different from the data stores you're probably used to.
* Getting Redis, Ruby and Rails playing together.
* A bunch of real use cases for web apps: the kind of things that you'd bend over backwards to do in a standard relational database, but can be achieved simply and powerfully with Redis.
* Considerations for Redis in production.

## Tim Riley

Tim is a partner and developer at [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au/), a digital design and development studio with offices in Canberra in Melbourne. He's been building web apps with Rails for the last six years, including sites like [Decaf Sucks](http://decafsucks.com/) and [RentMonkey](http://rentmonkey.com.au/). He introduced Redis into his toolkit a couple of years ago and hasn't looked back.

His biggest win with Redis so far has been using it to underpin the the _Ticketscout_ ticketing platform, which powers independent music venues [Corner Hotel](http://cornerhotel.com) & [Northcote Social Club](http://northcotesocialclub.com), and processes thousands of tickets per day.

Tim loves being a developer and probably spends too much time in front of a computer. Lately, he's tried to balance this by doing it in interesting places. In the last year he's lived in both the Philippines and Hong Kong. He still calls Australia home, because it's where the good coffee is.
