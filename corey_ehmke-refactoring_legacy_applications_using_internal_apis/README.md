# Refactoring Legacy Applications Using Internal APIs

Rails as a framework is famous for helping you get your application up and running quickly, but the very paradigms that make it so easy at the start can lead to maintenance nightmares down the road. Successful applications grow rapidly larger, more complex, and harder to extend and maintain.

One approach to refactoring a monolithic application is to divide it up into a series of smaller applications that organize the work of the system through internal APIs.

This talk will show you how to approach your refactoring using Faceted, a Ruby gem that is designed to create beautiful APIs using a flexible, declarative, and opinionated style. You will be introduced to Faceted, see examples of how to use it, and get a glimpse of the guiding philosophy behind the API-driven refactoring philosophy.
