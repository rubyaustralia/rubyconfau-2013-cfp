# Ruby Groups: Act Locally, Think Globally

There are thousands of local Ruby groups worldwide.  Sadly, many suffer along, become stagnant, some even die off.  How can you make your local Ruby Group better and in so doing, improve the global Ruby Community?

This talk focuses on the human side of getting a group together and making it successful so the members, as a group can contribute to the larger community.  It is a universally useful guide to improving all parts of the ruby community, starting on a local level.

## PJ Hagerty

A Ruby on Rails developer for the last 4 years, I currently work at Engine Yard for their world class Application Support team.  Additionally, I organize the Western New York Ruby Brigade.  Traveling to conferences and Ruby meet ups around the US and Canada, I like to spread the word on the importance of community and coding, stressing the importance of outreach and focusing on the human side of being a coder.

I've been known to organize impromptu conference jam sessions, karaoke smackdowns, and am a member of the Original "RailsConf Band".
