# Continuous Deployment Pipeline on Large Ruby Teams

Automated deployments of applications that are made up of a large number of services (in our case 20) can be hard, especially when there's a large team building them.

Here we discuss various branching strategies, ways to share code between the services, a continuous integration server performing unit tests on individual services & integration tests across all services, preparation of packages and automatic deployment to staging and production.

We will talk about how a CI pipeline, private gem servers, puppet scripts and a mouse-click come together to give us the one-click deployment everyone dreams of.
