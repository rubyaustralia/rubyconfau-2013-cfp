# Pessimism as a path to happiness

Bad Things are going to happen to you. Disks will crash, routers will drop
packets, and power supplies will let out the magic smoke. Servers will go
down - not only yours, but external services you rely on.

Things are going to get worse - not because the universe has it in for you,
but just because this is how things turn out. When it happens, you need to
have a plan.

Can you be more depressing than life itself? Is this the true path to
happiness, and better uptime?

This talk will be a lighthearted look at some of the things that can (and
do) go wrong with production services, and how building services with the
assumption that everything is going to fail can actually bring you peace of
mind.
