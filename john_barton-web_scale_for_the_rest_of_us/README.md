# Web-scale for the Rest of Us

On the internet, there seems to be two kinds of information available to do with "scaling rails", or on "scaling" in general.

  * Blog posts about how the really big boys are doing things
  * Blog posts full of non-production benchmarks explaining why you need a particular data store, templating framework, or anything else to be "web-scale"

This talk will hopefully be a third kind, practical advice to help you grow your application at the right pace alongside your business' growth, based on real world experience.

Topics covered will (probably) include:

  * Why you should probably choose Postgres or Mysql as your data store
  * Why going from one developer to two developers is the hardest
  * Why going from one server to two servers is the hardest
  * Why those two things are actually the same problem
  * How YAGNI and SRP apply to your hosting just as much as your code
  * How you balance your cost-speed-quality stool for developing your app up against the same cost-speed-quality tripod for your infrastructure
  * Why other people's advice on the topic can only ever provide a starting point, not a final answer

## John Barton

John Barton is, as yet, unaccustomed to writing in the third person. 

He is the co-founder of and chief tech guy for the world's greatest social film review site [Goodfilms](http://goodfil.ms), and formerly worked on the [Envato](http://envato.com) Marketplaces team. 

For Envato, he joined the Marketplaces as one of three developers, with one [mildly popular flash component marketplace](http://activeden.net) and around forty thousand registered users. He then helped launch a couple more marketplaces (including one [wildly popular web theme marketplace](http://themeforest.net)), before being passed the reigns as development manager and growing the team to around 10 developers, 9 Marketplaces, and well over a million registered users on the service. 

For Goodfilms, well there was that one time we sat on the Reddit frontpage overnight.
