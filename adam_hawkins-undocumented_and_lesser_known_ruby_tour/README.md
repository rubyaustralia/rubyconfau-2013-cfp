# Tour of Undocumented and Lesser Known Ruby Features

This talk is hard to pin down. It's hard to describe what you don't
know! The idea for this talk is based of JEG's talk from RailsConf, 42
things you didn't know Rails could do. This has as a pure ruby slant.
It's more about discovering undocumented syntax and lesser known
features from the stdlib.

## My Name

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
