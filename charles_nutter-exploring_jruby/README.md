High Performance Ruby
=====================

Ruby has become a global phenomenon, and more people use it every day. But too
often, Ruby is maligned for poor performance, poor scalability, and inability
to efficiently parallelize. It's time we changed those impressions.

This talk will cover strategies for optimizing Ruby code, from using different
Ruby implementations with better performance characteristics to generating code
and avoiding excessive object churn. We'll see how one implementation, JRuby,
optimizes different Ruby language constructs and how knowing a bit about your
Ruby impl of choice will help you write better code. And we'll explore the
future of Ruby for high performance computing and solutions to get us there.

If you don't know how to write faster, better Ruby code by the end of this
talk, I'll let you buy me a beer and we'll keep talking.
