# Too Many Models! Data structures in the Ruby world

With the rise of Ruby on Rails as the flagship web framework of the Ruby world far
too many of us have been dragged into the comfort zone that is modelling our data
structures the ActiveRecord way. It's just too damn convenient! With a simple
command I can have all the basic files required for my logic to work, and that means
little work and no thinking. This is all fun and games until you realize that your
database is polluted with unnecessary tables, and you have to struggle to figure out
where a particular piece of business logic should go because your models are not
clear enough in their separation of concerns. These are all symptoms to a problem in
your data modelling.

So how do we go about this? What is a model really? What is the problem we are
really trying to solve with ActiveRecord (or your ORM of choice)? When should we
apply it and when should we stick to a plain old ruby object? What are clear,
minimalistic patterns we can apply to our rails application to have coherent data
structures that accurately represent the reality of your application and basically
stay out of your way when implementing new stuff?

All these questions and more should be answered in this zoolander-themed talk!

## Pablo Astigarraga

I currently work at [Cubox](http://cuboxlabs.com) doing mostly cool Ruby stuff for the web.

I come from a Python background, dislike the term “hacking” and find joy in working with Ruby, contributing to the open source ecosystem or just generally building pretty stuff.

When I'm not at the office I like to keep a variety of hobbies in my endless quest to be a “Jack of All Trades” guy, I play bass and guitar on my band, follow science fiction and fantasy series such as Doctor who and A Song of Ice and Fire, play soccer like crazy every week and still struggle to keep my Kung Fu from getting rusty, mostly failing miserably.
