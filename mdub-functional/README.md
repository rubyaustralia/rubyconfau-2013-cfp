# Don't change a thing. Just be lazy.

What lessons can we learn from functional languages?  

This talk concentrates on two techniques common in functional programming: *immutable data*, and *lazy evaluation*.

We'll look at how such techniques can be implemented in Ruby, and examine how they can improve performance, support thread-safety, ease testing, and reduce bugs.
