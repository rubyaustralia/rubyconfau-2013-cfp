# Building your own PaaS with OpenShift

OpenShift is an open source Platform as a Service sponsored by Red Hat.
It is built with Ruby, and lets you manage your applications atop VMs,
which may be on IaaS such as OpenStack and Amazon EC2.

In this talk, we:

* review OpenShift's architecture
* set up OpenShift's components
* create and configure an application based on OpenShift's built-in types
* extend OpenShift by adding a new application type using
  [TorqueBox](http://torquebox.org).
