# The Web of Tomorrow

The web is changing and new changes are coming.

How will the new RFCs will affect the web as we know it?
What technologies will raise again?
Is Ruby prepared for this changes?

I want to answer these questions and talk about new web technologies and how we
need to change to adapt to this upcoming era.

From web sockets to WebRTC.
From distributed to decentralised.

The storm is coming... are you ready?
