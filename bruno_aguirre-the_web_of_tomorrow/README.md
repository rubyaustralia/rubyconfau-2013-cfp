# The Web of Tomorrow

The web is changing and new changes are coming.

How will the new RFCs will affect the web as we know it?
What technologies will raise again?
Is Ruby prepared for this changes?

I want to answer these questions and talk about new web technologies and how we
need to change to adapt to this upcoming era.

From web sockets to WebRTC.
From distributed to decentralised.

The storm is coming... are you ready?

## Bruno Aguirre aka elcuervo

Bruno (aka elcuervo) was raised by a group of savages of the telecommunications
tribe of the south. They took this developer to the distributed world and async
protocols. The progress of the city in these wild lands and the emperor's
penguin migration cycle took these developer to HTTP land where he attempts to
join both worlds. Protocol and research fan has his top secret lab in New
Context.

He is open-source-dependant, he maintains several projects and he is Gemini and
enjoys long walks and candle light lunches.
