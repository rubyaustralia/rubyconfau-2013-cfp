# The Journeyman's Path
This is a story about the path to mastery. We are all on the same journey and will encounter similar triumphs and turbulence. How did I start? What "red flags" changed my direction? What failures did I endure? And finally, what have I learned about _learning_ that guides me today? The answers to these questions can shed light on your path.

Ruby has catalyzed my rebirth as a software craftsman and being a Hashrocket Apprentice has changed my ideas about learning and mastery. The Hashrocket program is an Apprenticeship in the full sense of the word. The program teaches concrete techniques for learning, overcoming knowledge plateaus and taking the next step into mentorship. This approach to apprenticeship clears a path for beginners, rejuvenates the intermediate, and inspires the advanced on their own paths to mastery.
