# RailsBridge Workshop

Do you want to organize a RailsBridge workshop before or after Ruby Conf Australia? I can help! I would love to help organize and teach at a RailsBridge workshop for women as part of Ruby Conf Australia this year. We would need to find a venue (maybe one of the local Ruby dev shops would be willing to donate space?), some teachers (shouldn't be a problem with all the cool Rubyists in town for the conference!), probably a sponsor for an after-party and/or lunch, and of course students! What do you think? Can we make this happen? Please send me an email for more details at: railsbridge@nird.us, or comment on / accept this pull request!

She is teaching the Ruby section of the University of Washington's Ruby on Rails Certificate program, and does RailsBridge workshops whenever she can. Her corporate trainings and paying clients take up the rest of the time that she's not traveling the world to speak at really cool conferences in really cool places!
