# Test Driven Development: A Love Story

Practicing Test Driven Development (TDD) is like falling in love.  It may first seem like all your development problems will disappear.  However, it’s not all unicorns and rainbows.  You have to work at it, and keep working at it, for the rest of your development life.  It is hard, and it’s natural to question whether the value is worth the effort.

So why do it? Why would you bother going through all that trouble, dramatically changing the way you code, learn new domain specific languages, and initially slow down the rate at which you produce code when you have no time to lose?

This talk will answer the "why" by sharing my experience of passing through the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) as I learned TDD, and how acceptance grew to love.

You will walk away from the talk with techniques for maintaining and strengthening your relationship with TDD.  Test frameworks and languages may come and go, but the fundamentals and value of TDD remain.
