# Straightening Spaghetti

This is the story of Songkick and it's epic struggle against one gigantic Rails spaghetti monster. Follow our journey bravely slicing through the monsters spaghetti  tentacles, leaving in our wake lots of small, simple bits of spaghetti with very little attachment to Rails or monsters. Defaulting the knots and tangles of ActiveRecord, littered through our journey. Stepping cautiously over  bleeding layers of abstraction and sneaky traps. Ultimately our journey ends turning one monster into many smaller monsters. And the fight begins all over again.
