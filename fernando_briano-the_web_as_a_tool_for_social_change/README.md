# The web as a tool for social change

I'll talk about real life experiences with open data and government. I want to
share my point of view of how open data, free software and an Open Web help
us drive social change. Why as developers it's important to use these tools to
help achieve awareness, open institutions and transparent governments.

## Fernando Briano

Experienced in Java and PHP, Fernando moved to the Ruby world looking for fresh
air. He likes checking out new languages and frameworks all the time. Mostly
self taught programmer, he believes in the Free Software philosophy and thinks
that proprietary operative systems don’t deserve him as a user.

Fernando is also an avid blogger about programming, free software and more.
 Still not sure if it’s more fun to develop software or write and talk about the
 software development process. He reads a lot of comics and collects t-shirts.
 His favorite beverages are coffee and craft beer.
