# My Talk Title

Ruby 1.9 and JRuby offer the ability to tune garbage collection parameters.
What does that mean and why would you want to do it?

We'll first explore the general concepts behind memory management and garbage
collection. Then we'll get into some nitty gritty details. How does garbage
collection work in MRI, JRuby, and Rubinius? Most importantly, how can you use
this knowledge to improve the performance of your applications?

Attendees who demonstrate advanced knowledge of the material will receive a
pony.
