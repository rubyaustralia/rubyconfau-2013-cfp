# Beneath the Surface: Harnessing the True Power of Regular Expressions in Ruby

Many of us approach regular expressions with a certain fear and trepidation, using them only when absolutely necessary.  We can get by when we need to use them, but we hesitate to dive any deeper into their cryptic world.  But Ruby has so much more to offer us.  This talk will take you on a journey beneath the surface and showcase the incredible power of Ruby and the Oniguruma regex library Ruby runs on.  Regular expressions don’t have to be scary, there’s beauty, elegance, and usefulness to them.  This talk presents techniques for harnessing this power and beauty in your code.  You will learn flexible, dynamic, and eloquent ways to use regular expressions in Ruby.
