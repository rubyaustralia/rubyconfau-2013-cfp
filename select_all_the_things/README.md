# SELECT ALL THE THINGS; Database indexes for fun & profit!

Database indexing seems to have a reputation as something of a black art.
The two most common approaches are to index nothing or everything - neither
of which is the ideal strategy.

This talk will cover some common questions about database indexes, such as:

* What are indexes?
* Why should you add an index?
* How do you figure out what indexes you need?
* When *shouldn't* you add an index?

With practical examples using popular open source databases, hopefully by
the end of this talk you'll have gained some tips on using indexes to get
more from your database!
