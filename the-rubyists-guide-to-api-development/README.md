# The Rubyists Guide to API Development

A talk on the state of API development in Ruby.

First, it will cover the important considers when building an API - Namely, key things to
know when structuring your data, deciding how deal with responses and most importantly
how to make your API enjoyable for other developers to use - Something many APIs miss.

I'll also cover different parts of HTTP that can make life as an API developer more useful
and common considerations such as Auth, caching and other such magic.

Finally, it will end with a walk through of the options currently available
for building apis in Ruby (Sinatra, Grape, Rails, Rails-API and RocketPants)

The talk will be similar to / expanded upon a my [API Driven Development talk](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sutto/p/api-driven-applications)
given at RedDotRubyConf 2012 in Singapore.
