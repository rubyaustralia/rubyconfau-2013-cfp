# Security: a few terms, a few secrets, and a few hard truths

Remember how we all laughed when hackers got all the plaintext passwords for
the Playstation Network? Ever want to be in that position?  Me neither.

So how do we avoid mishaps? Before we can secure our applications we must
first be able to think and communicate clearly about security. Before we can
make good security decisions, we have to get our heads around security.

In this session Michael Brodhead will quickly cover a few bedrock terms and
some security tech you may have overlooked. Then we'll look at some of the big
picture concepts which can make the difference between good decisions and bad
ones.
