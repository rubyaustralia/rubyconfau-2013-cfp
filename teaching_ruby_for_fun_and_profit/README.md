# Teaching Ruby for Fun and Profit

How many companies are hiring Ruby developers right now? How many are finding qualified candidates? Why aren't workers swarming into our industry to fill up all these empty developer positions? Is learning Ruby really that hard? Why is learning Ruby so hard? Isn't it a language built by people for people? Shouldn't that be easy for anyone to pickup and use? Why isn't everyone building Ruby apps? I'm going to tell you. The good, the bad, and the goofy of trying to teach Ruby, Rails, and everything else we take for granted as RoR developers. There may even be a guest appearance from a real life Ruby Newbie to demonstrate!

## Renée De Voursney

Renée is the Chief Adventure Officer at a small RoR consultancy in Seattle WA USA called NIRD: Northwest Independent Ruby Development. She has been teaching Ruby, Rails, and everything else for the last couple of years to new programmers, experienced programmers, and sometimes to both at the same time! She is teaching the Ruby section of the University of Washington's Ruby on Rails Certificate program, and does RailsBridge workshops whenever she can. Her corporate trainings and paying clients take up the rest of the time that she's not traveling the world to speak at really cool conferences in really cool places!
