# Why use your own code when you can use the web?

A tale of the experience in moving from custom in house code to third party services. Our journey starts with custom code that generates thumbnails of websites using a headless webkit instance, resque jobs, and paperclip and ends up using a web service and s3 urls directly.

Rob Dawson has been writing and reusing code for years.  Rob loves writing Ruby, because often he isn't writing ruby, instead using other peoples code.  He's loving taking that to the next level and having other people maintain the code, and consuming RESTful services.
