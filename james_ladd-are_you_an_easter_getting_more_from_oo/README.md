# Are you an Easter? Getting more from OO

My talk description.

## James Ladd

James simply loves writing code and trying to find new ways to improve his code
and to help others improve theirs. With over 30 years of commercial experience
he has seen quite a few 'fads' come and go; used many languages 
(Assembler, C/C++, Java, Javascript, Smalltalk, Ruby); worked with a wide
variety of teams and projects, and even wrote his own implementation of
Smalltalk (http://redline.st). Sharing his experiences and learning from
others is what drives him. Words like funny, sharp and likable are often used
to describe James. If you get a chance to work through a problem with James 
it is likely you will learn something new on the way through.
