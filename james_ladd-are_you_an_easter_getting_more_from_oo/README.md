# Are you an Easter? Getting more from OO

This talk will show you how to get a lot more from OO, like increased reuse,
writing a lot less code and making what you do write more easily understood
and maintained. If you think you are doing OO then you might just want to see
this talk.

Objects and Object-oriented programming make their first appearance at MIT in the
late 1950s and early 1960s during work by researchers using LISP, a pure functional 
programming language. From then until the 1980's Objects and OO programming concepts
were largely used and extended exclusively by academic researchers. Then in the 
1981 August edition of Byte magazine, Smalltalk, a pure Object Oriented programming
environment and Object-oriented programming were introduced to a much wider audience.
From here OOP spread dramatically into almost every corner of programming and programming
languages.

Some 50 years on we are still trying to understand what makes a good Object-oriented 
program, why we haven't got the promised benefits of reuse and easily understood and
simple to maintain programs. In some circles we debate if OO is even necessary, and 
some say OO has failed. I put to you that OO has not failed but it is we who have 
failed OO.

  

## James Ladd

James simply loves writing code and trying to find new ways to improve his code
and to help others improve theirs. With over 30 years of commercial experience
he has seen quite a few 'fads' come and go; used many languages 
(Assembler, C/C++, Java, Javascript, Smalltalk, Ruby); worked with a wide
variety of teams and projects, and even wrote his own implementation of
Smalltalk (http://redline.st). Sharing his experiences and learning from
others is what drives him.
