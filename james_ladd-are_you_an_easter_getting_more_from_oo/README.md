# Are you an Easter? Getting more from OO

TL;DR;

This talk will show you how to get a lot more from OO, like increased reuse,
writing a lot less code and making what you do write more easily understood
and maintained. If you are doing OO then you want to see this talk.

Snapshot:

Objects and Object-oriented programming made their first appearance at MIT in the
late 1950s and early 1960s. Some 40 years on we are still trying to understand what makes
a good Object-oriented program and why we haven't got the promised benefits. Why do reusable, 
easily understood and simple to maintain programs continue to elude us? Some answer that
OO has failed us and set off in search of alternatives. I answer that we have failed OO.
How did we fail?

In this talk, I will be presenting both how we have failed and how we can tame and master OO.
An approach to modeling and implementing Objects. An approach I call East Oriented.
Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin, when introduced to East exclaimed: "Go East, young developer, go East."
What could cause a heavyweight of OO design to make such a proclamation? Come to my talk and find out.


## James Ladd

James simply loves writing code and trying to find new ways to improve his code
and to help others improve theirs. With over 30 years of commercial experience
he has seen quite a few 'fads' come and go; used many languages 
(Assembler, C/C++, Java, Javascript, Smalltalk, Ruby); worked with a wide
variety of teams and projects, and even wrote his own implementation of
Smalltalk (http://redline.st). Sharing his experiences and learning from
others is what drives him.
