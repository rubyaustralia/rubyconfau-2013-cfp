# Are you an Easter? Getting more from OO

This talk will show you how to get a lot more from OO, like increased reuse,
writing a lot less code and making what you do write more easily understood
and maintained. If you think you are doing OO then you want to see
this talk.

Objects and Object-oriented programming made their first appearance at MIT in the
late 1950s and early 1960s. Some 40 years on we are still trying to understand what makes
a good Object-oriented program and why we haven't got the promised benefits of reuse and
easily understood and simple to maintain programs. Some debate if OO is even necessary, 
turning to functional and procedural styles of programming. Some go so far as to say 
OO has failed! I put it to you that OO has not failed us but it is us who have failed
OO.
 
-- how did we fail
-- why did we fail
-- how we can fix it
 

## James Ladd

James simply loves writing code and trying to find new ways to improve his code
and to help others improve theirs. With over 30 years of commercial experience
he has seen quite a few 'fads' come and go; used many languages 
(Assembler, C/C++, Java, Javascript, Smalltalk, Ruby); worked with a wide
variety of teams and projects, and even wrote his own implementation of
Smalltalk (http://redline.st). Sharing his experiences and learning from
others is what drives him.
