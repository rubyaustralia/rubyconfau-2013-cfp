# Beautiful Ruby

Ruby is beautiful. Ruby is Zen. We stride far from jargon and buzzwords,
transcend rake and bundler and the latest hot new gem. We go looking for
code enlightenment -- We look at examples of beautiful ruby code and
meditate on the easy and elegent solutions of hard problems.

We explore quines to open the mind, puzzles to twist it, machine
learning to turn it upside down and functional programming paradigms
to turn it all the way inside out.

So take a break from requirements, put down your business logic and
rekindle your love of the beautiful program.
