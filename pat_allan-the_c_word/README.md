# The C Word

One of the most notable things about Ruby is its community - the passion towards writing good code, the opinions on how code should behave, the tools it produces, the people it draws to it, and yes, occasionally the arguments and drama.

Is this something we should take for granted? Should we be actively guiding the community to behave in a particular way? What makes up a healthy community? Are there ideas and wisdom can we take from other communities? So many questions â€“ let's see if we can find some answers!
