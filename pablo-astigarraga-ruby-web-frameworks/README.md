# Rails: We need to talk - Web Frameworks in the Ruby world.

Hey, I know this puts you in an awkward position because you like rails and you hang
out with her all the time, there is no easy way to put this but the thing is: I'm
having affairs with other frameworks, and of course it won't be easy talking to her
about this. So I was wondering if you could come and be a mediator for it? I hope
things don't turn ugly.

The truth is: I like rails, it definitely has a special place in my life, but I've
been around, and I've talked to people, and I find that there are others who are
sometimes more fun to hang out with in certain situations. Sinatra is just fantastic
to look at, although I have to admit Padrino is also pretty awesome and fun to be
with, Camping is super crazy (but believe me, she can definitely teach you stuff), and
of course there is also Rack, she is kind of shy and usually doesn't go out with
anyone if her friends are not coming, but she can be a lot of fun once you get to know
her.

The thing is: I want to be open to Rails and tell her why I like her, I still want to
spend time with her, but I think it's time to explain why our relationship shouldn't
be exclusive, so you know.. hopefully we could still be friends?

Talk Length: 25~ minutes.


## Pablo Astigarraga

I currently work at [Cubox](http://cuboxlabs.com) doing mostly cool Ruby stuff for the web.

I come from a Python background, dislike the term “hacking” and find joy in working with Ruby, contributing to the open source ecosystem or just generally building pretty stuff.

When I'm not at the office I like to keep a variety of hobbies in my endless quest to be a “Jack of All Trades” guy, I play bass and guitar on my band, follow science fiction and fantasy series such as Doctor who and A Song of Ice and Fire, play soccer like crazy every week and still struggle to keep my Kung Fu from getting rusty, mostly failing miserably.
