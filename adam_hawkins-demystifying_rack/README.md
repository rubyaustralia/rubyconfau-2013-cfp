# Demystifying Rack

Rack scared me. It seriously scared me. I had no idea what it was. I
thought it was magic. I had no idea what it does. I'm going to be Rack
preacher and remove the magic. The purpose is to explain what Rack, what
it does, and how we can put Ruby code online. After my talk the audience
will no longer will be scared. They will he happy and go forth and
spread Rack love :)

* Simple Rack apps
* Rack architecture
* Understanding middleware
* Composing Rack apps
* Serving Rack apps
* Complex Rack app
* Streaming Responses
* Understanding the Rack interface
* Cover the separation between servers and appliations

## My Name

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general

work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
