# Adventures in the hexagonal.

I'm passionate about TDD. I hate slow tests. I write app's that work
with Rails. I used to think these three things, (tests,speed,rails) was
a classic 'pick any two problem', now I don't.

I want to talk about building Rails apps; how we can use
hexagonal techniques to create code that is loosley coupled,
isolated, and hopefully better designed; how we can use the existing
Rails ecosystem to achieve this, hopefully present a few ideas on where
we can take this and encourage discussion.
