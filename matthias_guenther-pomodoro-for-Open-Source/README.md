# Pomodoro for Open Source

You know the constraints: Day job, time for your family, urge to hack, visiting the local user group, and
start a new project about the latest rocket science technology you need to learn. There is never enough
time for all this stuff at once. This talk will present the time management method, called Pomodoro. Learn
how to work timeboxed, get rid of distractions, focus on a single task for 25 minutes, and relax for
couple of minutes to free your mind. We all love Open Source work and Pomodoro will help you to hack
on your beloved babies in a timeboxed way to get more done in less time.
