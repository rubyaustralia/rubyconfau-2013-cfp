# Cryptography Pitfalls

Once the realm of shadowy government organizations, cryptography now permeates computing. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get correct and most developers know just enough to be harmful for their projects. Together, weâ€™ll go through the basics of modern cryptography and where things can go horribly wrong.

Specific topics:

* Cryptographic primitives
* Secure password storage
* Subtle flaws that can leave you insecure
* Why you should use TLS/SSL and GPG instead
