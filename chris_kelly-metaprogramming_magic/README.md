# Metaprogramming Magic

Ever wonder how New Relic manages to get all that information about your
application's performance with just a gem and no additional code? Wonder no more! 
I'll reveal the various 'magic' that we use to extract piles of performance data 
and do so with as little performance impact as possible. You'll see our 
metaprogramming tricks as well as look under the hood at both Ruby and Rails 
internals to see what info they provide out of the box. Of course, you could just 
go look at the gem source code yourself for all of this, but whose got time for that?
