# Developing for Ackability (and other ways to get along in large, autonomous engineering teams)

Autonomy, transparency, and sustainable velocity are among our core values at Yammer. The trust we have in each other puts all of our codebases in the hands of any of our 150+ engineers with assorted backgrounds and unique skill sets distributed over 3 continents. In addition to that, we're bringing new people on almost weekly. We do this with very few formal processes and a whole lot of success.

Contributing to a new or unfamiliar codebase can be challenging, especially when they are rapidly changing or not in your language of choice. You look for good examples of how things have been done in the past and then try your hardest not to break things. Some of our codebases are smaller and this comes at a much lesser cost. But others have grown over time or, in the case of our Rails application, were once the single monolithic codebase.

These larger codebases are in a constant state of surgery as things are pulled out and encapsulated into smaller services and codebases. We're far better off with smaller codebases, but we're still left with the challenge of developing features and moving the product forward in the meantime. Regardless of size, we optimize our codebases so that we can rely on ack, grep, or find in project to help navigate and quickly surface the relevant parts of code. Sometimes this means foregoing the elegant, clever, or metaprogramming solutions that make sense to us, but are difficult for others to consume.

Making sure your peers can follow a code trail easily or find out about the refactor or new abstraction that you're in the middle of will provide for more confident changes.  We've found a mixture of coding techniques, feature coordination, and the right communication goes a long way. Combine all of this with an endless supply of whisky and you get a surprisingly productive and effective way to build products.
