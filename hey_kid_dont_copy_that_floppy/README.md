# Hey kid! Don't copy that floppy!

Software licensing sets up rules for everyone to follow when contributing or using code. Some companies have specific policies on what types of licenses are compatible with their code base. Other companies put rules on their developers on how they're allowed to contribute code to software. Do you license your software?

This talk will review some popular open source software licenses and considerations you should make before contributing code. It's good to be aware of these rules before you end up on the wrong side of a Cease and Desist order.
