# Tell a story with your specs

We should write code to be read, and even more so with our specs. In RSpec You've got an amazing DSL, use it! Work through making some RSpecs gorgeous, using the features of the RSpec DSL, and the mighty malleable Ruby language. We'll take some standard specs that were written without much thought for the reader, and move them to telling a clear understandable story, using the features of Ruby and RSpec to edit out cruft, and make the story of our code easy to understand.
