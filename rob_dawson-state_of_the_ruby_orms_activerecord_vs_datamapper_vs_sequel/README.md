# State of the Ruby ORMs - ActiveRecord vs DataMapper vs Sequel

A battle hardened coder shares their hard earned experiences from the trenches of using ActiveRecord, DataMapper and Sequel, covering what the strengths and weaknesses of each project is, where you are likely to feel pain, and when you might want to pick each of these. We'll also touch on some of the other trendy guys out there, looking at the world of NoSQL, and what avoiding ORMs might do for your code base.

## Rob Dawson

Rob Dawson started off his career doing Oracle development last century, and has had an interest in where the database meets application code for years.  As an ex-application DBA he knows SQL and where ORMs help and hurt.  Rob's been worked with more ORMs than he can remember, and is currently actively using a couple of versions of ActiveRecord,  MongoMapper, and DataMapper.  By day Rob's doing DataMapper at RSA, and by night ActiveRecord, with a bit of MongoMapper on the side.
