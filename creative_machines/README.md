# Creative Machines

Alan Turing set out to find the answer to the question: "Can machines think?". Thinking, that's easy! Even my dishwasher can do that (it's a really smart dishwasher). How about we try something harder and push into a new area of AI: "Can machines be creative?". We will put forward a new Creative Machine test and thats were you all get to participate (participation mandatory). Can you distinguish between a machine's creative attempts and a humans? Along our journey down the path of discovering a new generation of artists, born through Ruby, we will look into the heart of each machine-artist. Examining different algorithms/techniques and their effectiveness at exhibiting creativeness. Also how slowly killing a neural network lead to some of the greatest progress in creative machines.

*Warning* machines will be harmed in the process of making this art.
